## Deploying the Inventory Service

*5 MINUTES PRACTICE*

In this lab you will learn about building and deploying a microservice based on Java/Maven on OpenShift. 
The `Inventory Service` is part of the Cool Store architecture to provide the quantity (hence the availability too) of a given product by ID.

#### What is Thorntail?

Java EE applications are traditionally created as an `ear` or `war` archive including all 
dependencies and deployed in an application server. Multiple Java EE applications can and 
were typically deployed in the same application server. This model is well understood in 
development teams and has been used over the past several years.

Thorntail offers an innovative approach to packaging and running Java EE applications by 
packaging them with just enough of the Java EE server runtime to be able to run them directly 
on the JVM using `java -jar`. For more details on various approaches to packaging Java 
applications, read [this blog post](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/08/24/the-skinny-on-fat-thin-hollow-and-uber).

Thorntail is based on WildFly and it's compatible with 
MicroProfile, which is a community effort to standardize the subset of Java EE standards 
such as JAX-RS, CDI and JSON-P that are useful for building microservices applications.

Since Thorntail is based on Java EE standards, it significantly simplifies refactoring 
existing Java EE applications to microservices and allows much of the existing code-base to be 
reused in the new services.

#### Thorntail Maven Project 

The `inventory-thorntail` project has the following structure which shows the components of 
the Thorntail project laid out in different subdirectories according to Maven best practices:

![Inventory Project]({% image_path thorntail-inventory-project.png %}){:width="200px"}

This is a minimal Java EE project with support for JAX-RS for building RESTful services and JPA for connecting
to a database. [JAX-RS](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/jaxrs.htm) is one of Java EE standards that uses Java annotations to simplify the development of RESTful web services. [Java Persistence API (JPA)](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/partpersist.htm) is another Java EE standard that provides Java developers with an object/relational mapping facility for managing relational data in Java applications.

#### Deploy Inventory on OpenShift

Now itâ€™s time to build and deploy our service on OpenShift. 

OpenShift [Source-to-Image (S2I)]({{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build) 
feature can be used to build a container image from a git repository. OpenShift S2I uses the [supported OpenJDK container image](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_middleware_for_openshift/3/html/red_hat_java_s2i_for_openshift) to build the final container image of the 
Inventory service by building the WildFly Swam uber-jar from source code (build strategy **'Source'**), using Maven, to the OpenShift platform.

To build and deploy the `Inventory Service` on OpenShift using the `fabric8` maven plugin, 
which is already configured in CodeReady Workspaces, click on inventory-thorntail project in the project explorer then, from the commands palette, click on **DEPLOY > fabric8:deploy**

![Fabric8 Deploy]({% image_path eclipse-che-commands-deploy.png %}){:width="340px"}


During the deployment, you might see that Fabric8 Maven Plugin throws an `java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException` 
exception. This is due to [a bug](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/1035) in one of Fabric8 Maven Plugin 
dependencies which is being worked on right now and will be fixed soon. You can ignore this exception for now. The deployment 
nevertheless succeeds.

![Inventory Deployed]({% image_path wfswarm-inventory-che-deployed.png %}){:width="800px"}

`fabric8:deploy` will cause the following to happen:

* The Inventory uber-jar is built using Thorntail
* A container image is built on OpenShift containing the Inventory uber-jar and JDK
* All necessary objects are created within the OpenShift project to deploy the Inventory service

Once this completes, your project should be up and running. You can see the expose DNS url for the `Inventory service` in the OpenShift Web Console or using 
OpenShift CLI.

~~~shell
$ oc get routes

NAME        HOST/PORT                                       PATH        SERVICES        PORT        TERMINATION   
inventory   inventory-{{COOLSTORE_PROJECT}}.{{APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX}}                    inventory       8080        None
~~~

> The route urls in your project would be different from the ones in this lab guide!

Click on the `Inventory Route` in the OpenShift Web Console.

![Inventory Service]({% image_path inventory-service.png %}){:width="500px"}

Then click on `Test it`. You should have the following output:

~~~shell
{"itemId":"329299","quantity":35}
~~~

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
